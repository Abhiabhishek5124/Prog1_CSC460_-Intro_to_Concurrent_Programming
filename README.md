# Concurrent Programming Project

## Overview
This repository contains a Java project focusing on concurrent programming concepts. The project is structured into three distinct parts, each addressing various aspects of concurrent programming and synchronization techniques.

### Part 1: No Synchronization
This part illustrates the consequences of lacking synchronization in multithreaded programs.

### Part 2: Synchronized Methods
Here, Java's synchronized keyword is employed to ensure thread-safe access to shared resources.

### Part 3: Semaphores
This section implements synchronization using Java's Semaphore class to manage access to shared resources.

## Getting Started
To run the project, ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java files using the command:

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:
- `Main.java`: Main class serving as the entry point and orchestrating the different parts.
- `noSynch.java`: Implementation of Part 1 - No Synchronization.
- `Aclass.java`, `Bclass.java`, `Cclass.java`, `Dclass.java`: Implementations of Part 2 - Synchronized Methods.
- `myCounter.java`, `myProcess.java`: Implementations of Part 3 - Semaphores.

## Contribution
Contributions to the project are encouraged. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
